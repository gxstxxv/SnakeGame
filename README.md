# SnakeGame

This is a small terminal game, which is supposed to represent the well-known game snake. 
There is a small difference in that the player himself sets the pace. 
The challenge is no longer to collect all the apples, but rather to do so in a short time.

-> [Speed Snake]

You start as a circle in the middle of the field together with a randomly generated apple(a).

You can move the "snake" by entering the direction using the wasd keys and pressing the enter key. 

During the game, the game duration and the apple score are also displayed below the playing field.
